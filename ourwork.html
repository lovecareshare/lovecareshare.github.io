					<hr>
                    <p><font color="red">1.An Organizational Approach–</font>An unorganized society has no scope for development, hence we work on issues of those living under economic marginalization, feudal traditions, gender stereotypes and inequalities and environmental degradation among other social issues, to get organized into community and issue-oriented groups and networks and to support those already formed.</p>
					<p><font color="red">2. A Rights Based Approach – </font>We work with the people to claim, and reclaim, their human rights i.e. right to life, to work, to a life with dignity, to food, to land and livelihood.</p>
					<p><font color="red">3. An Educational Approach – </font>In which “praxis” (action-reflection-action), learning from experience, learning from analysis, learning from each other, training events, awareness raising camps,  exposure visits and tours, learning from “people’s knowledge”, all play major roles. </p>
					<p><font color="red">4. A Developmental Approach – </font>In which we attempt to initiate processes, make linkages, set in motion problem solving actions…and yet an approach which questions the dominant paradigm of “Development”. We, with the people, are in search of a new definition of “Development” which would respect and take seriously viable lifestyles for sustainable development, indigenous people’s social and survival patterns, people’s knowledge, and so on. </p>

					<p>As we are learning from our childhood that “We should share what we have..... Right, but we should also not forget the needy ones who really want things which they couldn’t afford. As we all are aware about the Disease AIDS. But let’s keep in mind that it is NOT A TRANSFERABLE OR SPREADABLE DISEASE. So why to Discriminate between them and us. Who are they and why should we ignore them. They also have same color of blood, that’s RED. That means even they are humans.</p>
					<p>There are many children who are away from their homes or who are thrown out from their homes by their own parents and just because there are suffering from AIDS. According to <u>UNICEF India</u> there are 220,000 children infected by HIV/AIDS in India. It is approximated that every year 55,000 to 60,000 children are born to mothers who are HIV positive. 30% of these children are likely to be infected themselves. According to a publication of <u>NACO and MWCD</u> there are 2-3 million people in India living with HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that 70,000 children below the age of 15 infected with 21,000 children being infected through mother-child transmission every year. After all this still our society blames the children’s for being affected by such a Disease.</p>
					<p>But people like Mrs. UjwalaLawate(Founder of MANAVYA ) are still alive and will be always there for these children. MANAVYA is just like a little home for the children who are suffering from HIV and are given treatment and gives them a hope to live there life to fullest. Her team and she love’s the children like their own children. There are approx.  30-50 little ones living under the same roof without any single problem. They all live like a family and help each other in whatever situation they are facing.</p>
					<p>As a little contribution and help to this children for their better future, the LCS (i.e. Love Care Share Organization) put a step forward and are willing to change the thinking of society and help the society for its betterment . As the team decided to visit to MANAVYA on 9th April 2016 for spending some time with this lovely children and let them enjoy the moments . Before entering into the place the team never knew what a true happiness Is. But after entering that day the team realized what exactly the true happiness is and how it feels. </p>
					<p>As we met to Mrs. UjawalaLawate Mam we listen to her unexpected and tough journey to bring the little ones under one roof. The Team also met her team members like Mr. Shaikh Sir, who was the only guy because of whom the team found and get to know about this lovely place. The team had fun with those children playing games, cracking jokes etc. After this unforgettable fun the team had lunch with all children that was well organized by the team itself. The children were full energetic after having the lunch. During this all the team donated Grocery as a small help for the MANAVYA. </p>
					<p>After the team spending the whole day over there with them the team members learned many things from them and got to know what life is without parents and what life is suffering such disease. But the children need to be given Hats Off, even being with this disease they knew how to spend the life happily supporting each other and their smile is just like a star that shines and sparkles in the night. </p>

                    <p>It was a pleasant Sunday morning on <u>15th May </u>when the whole Team of LOVE CARE SHARE carried out this event of distribution of Mineral Water for the SNEHAKSHITIJ NGO.<b><i><font color="red"> Loving, caring, sharing </font></i></b>are the core principles on which we firmly believe and this Donation was a part of contribution back to the society.</p>
					<p>The organization <b><u>SNEHAKSHITIJ </u></b>works for differently disabled students, had planned a trek to SHIMLA for the little champions and we donated about 120-130 bottles as a part of our program. SNEHAKSHITIJ plans a trek for these kids every year to different locations and it is one of its kind intuition for these differently disabled students.</p> 
					<p>The team of LOVE CARE SHARE was present at 7 in the morning at PUNE RAILWAY junctionfor the donation of water bottles. Our Team met the Founder and Trustee of SNEHAKSHITIJ <u>Mrs. ChanchalaDavande</u> for the donation and she eagerly accepted this generous donation for her organization. These special kids were ecstatic about this donation and were very happy when we met them at the PUNE RAILWAY junction. The team members also helped these kids to transfer their luggage from the entrance to their railway coach as a part of our project.</p> 
					<p>This pleasant Sunday was well spent doing community service. The happiness that was felt by all the members couldn’t be expressed in words. The members of the SNEHAKSHITIJ trust were overwhelmed by the support which we provided considering our budding position in social service. This program was just a small tribute from our team towards social work.</p>

					<p>As rightly said by the noble peace prize winner MALALA YOUSAFZAI a book, a pen and a child always are the most important aspects when a change has to be brought into the society. We the TEAM of <b>LOVE CARE SHARE</b> with this objective in mind contributed once again to the society by successfully hosting our event of <b>BOOK-A-THON.</b></p>
					<p>On the 25th June we the team of LCS hosted this event of book and stationary donation at <u>ADHAR MUK BADHIR VIDYALAYA</u> located at BIBVEWADI and <u>AKSHARSPARSHA MATIMANDA VIDYALAYA</u> located in AMBEGAON PATHAR PUNE. <font color="red"><b>LOVING, CARING AND SHARING</b></font> are the core principles on which we firmly believe and this donation was a part of contribution back to the society.</p>
					<p>We the team of LOVE CARE SHARE were present at 11 in the morning in the schools for donation. Our team met the board of trustees of the school for the donation and they inspired us to continue the good work which we have been doing. Charity is best done when the most fringe and neglected parts of the society are benefited the most and we TEAM LCS specifically try to contribute to such sections.</p> 
					<p>A total of 125-150 mute and dumb students were benefitted when we donated each student 2 notebooks along with a stationary kit. The stationary kit included of the most basic requirements of a student which are Pencil, Scale, Eraser and a sharpener. The kids were overjoyed when we made this donation and volunteers interacted with the students. The event was part of our EDUCATION FOR ALL INITIATIVE.</p>
